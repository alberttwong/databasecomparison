## OLAP databases
I use the term loosely.   I consider OLAP databases to range from Trino/Presto/Athena (it's federated query engine but people use it like a database), Dremio, ClickHouse, Apache Druid, Apache Pinot, Snowflake, AWS RedShift, GCP BigQuery and others.

This is a good list to show who is in the OLAP database space.  https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/

### List of OLAP databases that utilize SIMD (Single Instruction Mutiple Data)
What is database that uses SIMD  https://atwong.medium.com/the-hottest-area-of-database-design-querying-billions-of-rows-per-second-with-simd-aa705fb5dfb6

Here is a list of databases that are known to utilize SIMD.  As you can see, from the ClickHouse Benchmark, databases with SIMD dominate the leaderboard. 
* ClickHouse: https://clickhouse.com/docs/zh/faq/general/why-clickhouse-is-so-fast
* Apache Druid: (maybe? https://imply.io/blog/announcing-druid-0-16-0/)
* StarRocks: https://docs.starrocks.io/en-us/latest/introduction/StarRocks_intro
* QuestDB: https://questdb.io/blog/2020/04/02/using-simd-to-aggregate-billions-of-rows-per-second/

* DuckDB: https://duckdb.org/faq.html#does-duckdb-use-simd
* AWS RedShift: https://assets.amazon.science/93/e0/a347021a4c6fbbccd5a056580d00/sigmod22-redshift-reinvented.pdf

## List of OLAP databases that support primary key to support batch and streaming upsert
Why is primary key support important to batch and streaming insert, update, delete and upsert scenarios. https://atwong.medium.com/list-of-olap-databases-that-support-primary-key-8e42a65fbee3
* StarRocks: https://docs.starrocks.io/en-us/latest/table_design/table_types/primary_key_table
* ClickHouse: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/optimize/sparse-primary-indexes#a-table-with-a-primary-key

### List of OLAP databases that support the MySQL protocol
* Dolt database (OLTP): Dolt is a SQL database you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push and pull just like a Git repository. Connect to Dolt just like any MySQL database to run SQL queries. Use the command line interface to import CSV files, commit your changes, push them to a remote, or merge your teammateâ€™s changes. https://www.dolthub.com/
* StarRocks (OLAP): StarRocks is a next-gen sub-second MPP database for full analytics scenarios, including multi-dimensional analytics, real-time analytics and ad-hoc query. https://www.starrocks.io/
* TiDB (OLTP+OLAP): TiDB is an open-source distributed SQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. https://www.pingcap.com/
* Sphinx Search (Search): Sphinx is a fulltext search engine that provides text search functionality to client applications. https://sphinxsearch.com/

### List of OLAP databases that uses a cost based optimizer (CBO) or rule based optimizer for query execution
* StarRocks: (cbo) https://docs.starrocks.io/en-us/latest/introduction/StarRocks_intro
* ClickHouse: (rbo)
